Object Oriented Concepts

## Watch this awesome introduction into Object Oriented Programming concepts and edit this README to record what you feel is one of the major benefits you see in OO programming. You also learn yet another valuable programming term...  Spaghetti code!

### GOTO Me going into excurciating detail as I am known to do :-)

Sure, we can just use variables and functions for what we need to do at a given moment, but when we need to store related bits of information and reuse them it's much better to create and use objects.

In the old days, not only did I have to walk through the snow (uphill both ways mind you), but we also coded everything ##procedural## which means our programs basically ran top -> down and were built to get the job down once without regard to the obvious fact that we would likely need to do the same things with slight variations in the future. 

There was no concept of 'objects' so we would end up copying a bunch of code and making minor mods.

This worked just fine, but we ended up with LOTS of variations of our code base checked into version control and became impossible to maintain as we added additional functionality.

Object Oriented programming evolved from this practice and was a big leap.


I like Encapsulation and Inheritance, mainly to limit or reduce using the same code over and over again.
